Is your deployment failing, even though you *just know* you did everything exactly as you always do? 

Before you spend hours troubleshooting something you wouldn't be able to fix anyway, don't forget to check the **status page** of the hosting service you are using!

Here are a few:
- [GitHub](https://www.githubstatus.com/)
- [Heroku](https://status.heroku.com/)
- [Firebase](https://status.firebase.google.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlifystatus.com/)

This happened to me today with my new Portfolio. My CLI said my project was published to GitHub Pages, but none of the changes I made were showing up in the site. I broke everything trying to make my repository private and then public again to force GitHub to republish. 

So I was stuck with a 404, and I had just applied for an exciting role with a potential employer using the link to my new Portfolio!

But as it turns out, sometimes the system *is* actually down.
